# lagswitch

Automatically toggle your internet connection (for Linux), with a customisable delay.

# Installation

Simply download the `lagswitch` binary from the release tab, or compile this yourself.

If it does not work, run `chmod a+x lagswitch` to give it extra permissions.

# Usage

`lagswitch -s <seconds>` will disable the connection and enable it again after the specified number of seconds.

`lagswitch -f` will attempt to fix the connection if it the program was interrupted before it could reconnect.

`lagswitch -h` will provide you with help.

# Why would I want this?

In some games, such as Roblox, pausing your internet connection gives you a few seconds to move around. You will not be kicked as long as you reconnect within 10 seconds.

To other players, it will look as though you have teleported. Furthermore, teleportation in some games can be disrupted for some unexpected results!
